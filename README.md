# SV Go

## Purpose
This is an android application that is being created to gain experience developing android
applications written in Java, using git, solidifying programming fundamentals, and designing
an application from markup to deployment.

#### Code Rules
  * SV Go shall be written in Java. 
  * Application shall be written with strong variable typing.  
     * This is to build good coding practices, and to have code written as explicit as possible. 
  * Each line shall have a 100 character limit.  
     * This is to improve code readability as it is easier to read code in a digestible format and
     allows code to be diffed without excessive scrolling.
  * Each variable name shall be written with a meaning naming convention and use the correct prefix 
  where required. 
     * This is to help improve code readability.
  * Code shall be properly formatted.  
     * This is to maintain consistency throughout all of the code files.
  * Developing shall be TDD. (Test-Driven Development)
     *  Every feature introduced will be thoroughly tested using unit testing as well as 
     instrumented testing. We will have a minimum of 80% target code coverage. This is to give us 
     confidence that we have tested thoroughly, and will reduce tests that do not provide value, 
     or are hard to test.    
  * Each method that is created shall have a single responsibility and will reuse code when possible
     * This ensures that code remains easily testable and is not cumbersome to debug.
